### Hi there 👋
I'm Chris, a software developer with several years of industry experience.  

Python is my current main driver 🐍

I'm pretty passionate about software and currently focused on backend/full-stack!  
Looking to do more software-engineering 🛠️ 

Currently playing around with: GCP, FastApi. Next up: More k8s, to unlearn Openshift.

Have a look around! Most of my recent stuff is pinned below! :)
